# Java-Code-Complexity-Analysis---Halstead-Complexity
Software complexity can be defined as the degree of difficulty in analysis, testing, design and implementation of software.

# By using these parameters, Halsted theory can be defined as a set of complexity measures

n1 = number of unique or distinct operators appearing in a program.
n2 = number of unique or distinct operands.
N1 = total number of operators (implementation).
N2 = total number of operands (implementation).
